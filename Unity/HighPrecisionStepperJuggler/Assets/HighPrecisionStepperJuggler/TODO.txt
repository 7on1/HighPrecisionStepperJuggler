
[ ] make model playback multiple instructions in order
    [X] playback in order
    [ ] add animation
    
[X] image processing
    [X] find a good way to show the image in unity
[X] find a good way to set camera parameters in runtime mode.
[X] OpenCV hough-transform optimazations
    [X] make OpenCVs houghTransform on/off settable
    [X] also make all other parameters settable
    [X] custom grayscale image made by subtracting blue from red channel and then using that red chennal as gray image.
    [X] add ability to show grayscale + image processing result in Unity
[X] test with plate on 2cm height
[X] get ball position and radius into unity
[X] record height from radius data.
[X] get real height from radius data.
[X] calculate real x and y position from pixel x and y position with height data.
[ ] Write latex math file
[ ] play around and figure out some interesting moves
    [ ] staircase bouncing
    [ ] hard hit when centering is good
        [ ] maybe still plate after hard hit
    [ ] moving PID center with high plate and rolling ball
[ ] refactor ImageProcessingInstructionSender (add new classes and split responsibility)


lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523
