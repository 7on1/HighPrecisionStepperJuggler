
[ ] play around and figure out some interesting moves
    [ ] staircase bouncing
    [ ] hard hit when centering is good
        [ ] maybe still plate after hard hit
    [ ] moving PID center with high plate and rolling ball
    [ ] machine look at ball mode.
[X] refactor ImageProcessingInstructionSender (add new classes and split responsibility)
    [X] add BallData class.
    [X] add interface to make multiple moveControllingStrategies possible.
[X] add start button
[X] add ping pong ball 3D position data visualization.
    [X] make ball visualization fade out and disappear.
    [X] make it appear at the correct position.
        [X] rotate & offset
[ ] add level-calibration.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523
