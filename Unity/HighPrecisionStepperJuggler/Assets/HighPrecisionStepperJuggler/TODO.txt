
[X] make plate move with arms.
[X] make tilt work correctly.
[X] update model data in fusion360 to acryl plate state.
[X] make upper most link turn corresponding to the tilt.
    [X] make it turnable
    [X] turn it the correct amount
[X] fix problem where tilt is behaving strange in the range 1 ~ 2
[X] fix Quaternion multiplication problem. 
[X] fix unit mixup.
[X] width correction from tilt.
[X] refactor
[ ] endPoint-structure (send movement-information either to the model or the microcontroller)
[ ] test sending something to the microcontroller
[ ] get some test rotations for tilting and run them on the machine.

[ ] drill holes in acryl and mount it on machine.
[ ] Write latex math file

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523
