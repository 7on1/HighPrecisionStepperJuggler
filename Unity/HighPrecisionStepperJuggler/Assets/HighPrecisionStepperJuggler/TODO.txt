
[X] Test the other motor driver.
[ ] figure out how fast we have to move to get the ball flying.
    [ ] check how fast the old build moves?
[X] Test the camera

// UNITY

[X] edit mode script execution
[X] fix buggy render jumps
[X] IK needs to become part of MotorController (and shouldn't be a MonoBehaviour)
[X] Add MotorController
[X] create a table mesh thing
[X] implement the how-far-to-rotate-from target y-move-distance
[X] test whether or not the table's tilt will be constant when moving up tilted
[X] implement the cos() motor driving to get the model to move just like the real machine
[ ] add another 2 motors
[ ] make the plate tilt accordingly

[ ] add new offset variable to compensate for changing table width in x dir when tilting in y dir
[ ] make it look nicer (nicer shading)



memo:


right now we got:

TargetY     -->      [   InverseKinematic   ]     ->     [   basicJoints   ]


What we want:

TargetYCurrent     -->      [   InverseKinematic   ]     ->     [   basicJoints   ]
TargetYGoal        -->      [   InverseKinematic   ]     ->     [   basicJoints   ]
