[ ] Write latex math file
[ ] add new offset variable to compensate for changing table width on x-axis when tilting around y axis
    [ ] WidthCompensationFromTilt
[ ] start work on designing the actual parts
[ ] get new model moving

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523

[ ] drill holes in acryl and mount it on machine.



memo:


right now we got:

TargetY     -->      [   InverseKinematic   ]     ->     [   basicJoints   ]


What we want:

TargetYCurrent     -->      [   InverseKinematic   ]     ->     [   basicJoints   ]
TargetYGoal        -->      [   InverseKinematic   ]     ->     [   basicJoints   ]
